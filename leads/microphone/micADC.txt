There should also be a large folder containing all the files generated
by Quartus for the microphone ADC IP, which in our instantiation we've
named `micADC`; however, that entire folder is rather pointless to
include, so we're leaving it out here. Create the ADC IP yourself using
the instructions in the lab spec.
